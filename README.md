## What is it?

The learn-api repository contains exercises made during my formation @ Becode.
Some exercises were made at BeCode. Others come from OpenClassrooms

### BeCode Exercises

#### Exercise 1 : API Carousel

This first exercise is a webpage where I fetch data from an API and create a Bootstrap carousel containing this data (images and texts).

#### Exercise 2 : API Wikipedia

Webpage with a Bootstrap navbar at the top.
When entering something in the search section of the navbar, you get a list of wikipedia articles and upon submit, displays the wikipedia article chosen (or the one closest to what has been written) on the rest of the page.
The WikiMedia opensearch API has been used for this exercise.

### Openclassroom Exercises

#### Exercise 1 : text-to-voice

The exercise was to use an IBM API (using an authentification key) to transform text into a wav (or ogg) audio file.
