# learn-api

## What is it?

The learn-api repository contains exercises made during my formation @ Becode.
Some exercises were made at BeCode. Others come from OpenClassrooms

### Exercise 1 : API Carousel

This first exercise is a webpage where I fetch data from an API and create a Bootstrap carousel containing this data (images and texts).
